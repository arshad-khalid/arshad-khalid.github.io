# Personal Website 🌐

Welcome to my personal website! 🎉 It's built using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator, and deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The foundation of the site is based on the elegant [Cactus theme](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus) by [@probberechts](https://github.com/probberechts), with several customizations and tweaks to the design, layout, and styling to make it my own.

Feel free to explore the site, use this template, or take any bits and pieces you like for your own projects. Contributions and feedback are always welcome! 😄
